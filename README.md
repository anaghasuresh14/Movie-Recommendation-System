Movie Recommender System:

This is a movie recommender system that seeks to provide recommendations to users based on the similarity between the contents of the movies i.e by content based filtering.

The dataset that has been used: TMDB 5000 movie dataset 

Types of Recommender Systems:
1. Content Based:
   These recommend items similar to those a user liked in the past.
   They analyze item features like tags, genres, descriptions, etc.
   For example, if you liked action movies, it recommends other action movies.
   
3. Collaborative Filtering Based:
   These recommend items based on user behavior and preferences.
   They find patterns and similarities between users.
   For instance, if User A and User B have similar movie-watching habits, User Aâ€™s preferences can be used to recommend movies 
   to User B.
